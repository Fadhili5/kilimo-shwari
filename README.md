**KILIMO SHWARI** is an Enterprise Breeding System (EBS) designed to aid crop breeding programs and provide valuable insights to resource-poor farmers in Africa. Leveraging comprehensive datasets and advanced analysis techniques, this project aims to enhance agricultural productivity by delivering precise recommendations on crop suitability, soil health, and climate adaptability.


## Project Objectives
- **Integrate Comprehensive Data Sources**: Combine soil, climate, crop, water resources, and socioeconomic data to create a robust decision-support system.
- **Crop Suitability Analysis**: Use detailed datasets to evaluate the suitability of different regions for various crops.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Develop and deploy machine learning models to predict crop yields and identify optimal breeding strategies.
- **Climate Analysis**: Analyze historical and projected climate data to understand its impact on crop productivity.
- **Interactive Web Application**: Develop a user-friendly web application that allows farmers and breeders to access and interact with the data.
